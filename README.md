# In this repository, I included the codes for testing important packages that I used for my data analyses.

## Use `Rcpp`

This repository contains my test codes for using `Rcpp` package. By using `Rcpp`, we can implement C++ codes into R more conveniently. 

Some basic syntax of C++ were shown in `RcppTest1.Rmd` document.

## `TOAST` R package

This R package is recently published and used for estimating cell composition for different tissues. 

I will test and also compare `TOAST` package with `RefFreeEWAS` R package. These 2 packages are different in terms of the feature selection process, so I want to see whehter the results from these 2 packages will be different or not.

## Test the cell type adjustment example, from the 2016 article (An evaluation of methods correcting for cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation studies)

This example is from github (https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/CellTypeAdjustment).
