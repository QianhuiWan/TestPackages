# In this repository, I included the codes for testing important packages that I used for my data analyses.

## Use `Rcpp`

This repository contains my test codes for using `Rcpp` package. By using `Rcpp`, we can implement C++ codes into R more conveniently. 

Some basic syntax of C++ were shown in `RcppTest1.Rmd` document.

## `TOAST` R package

This R package is used for estimating cell composition for different tissue types.
